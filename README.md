Dynamic Billiards Simulation
Billiards  Simulation

Description
This GitHub project presents a dynamic simulation of a Billiards  that allows users to visualize and interact with three different simulation models. The simulation accurately represents the movement and rotation of Billiards  balls on a Billiards  table.

Features
Position Showing Model: The first simulation model displays the positions of the Billiards  balls on the Billiards  table as they move and collide with each other. Users can observe the realistic motion of the balls across the table.

Position and Rotation in Billiards  Plane Model: The second simulation model enhances the visualization by not only showing the positions of the Billiards  balls but also illustrating their rotations within the Billiards  plane. This enables users to get a better understanding of the rotational dynamics during the ball movements.

Position and Rotation in All Directions Model: The third and most advanced simulation model extends the visualization beyond the Billiards  plane. Users can now observe the positions and rotations of the Billiards  balls in all directions, providing a more immersive experience and better insights into the three-dimensional dynamics.
